# Kickstart ELK
The ultimate aim of this ELK (Elastic) starter-kit is to help you collect log, metric, and performance data of sample CRM app service running on Docker containers. We use Beats framework to collect and push the data to Logstash, whereas Logstash parses the data and index it to Elasticsearch for building visualizations and dashboards on Kibana user interface.
